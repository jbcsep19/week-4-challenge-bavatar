    <pre>
Learn to develop professional web applications using the most popular programming
language in the world.

This program takes you from writing your first Java class to developing a
complete website. This guide contains lessons that will give you a jump start
on your career. Detailed instructions enable you to successfully complete
the many problems. You'll get immediate feedback as you check them against
supplied solutions. Programming challenges will keep you engaged, interested
and on your toes.

You will develop skills creating applications using the MVC pattern. You’ll
use a templating engine (Thymeleaf).  You’ll connect to a MySQL database using
an ORM, and learn how to write applications that can connect to other databases
such as PostgreSQL and Oracle.

And you’ll learn best practices from the experiences of others.

Upon the completion of the bootcamp, you will receive a voucher for one free
exam of the AWS Certified Developer - Associate (Links to an external site.)'s
certification. We will NOT cover materials on this certification during this
8-10 week bootcamp. This is offered as an incentive for your completion.
